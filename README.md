### Did you find a bug?

* **Do not open up a GitHub issue if the bug is a security vulnerability
**, and instead reach out directly to the [team](mailto:contact@zapic.com).

* **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/ZapicInc/Support/issues).

* If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem or feature request, [open a new one](https://github.com/ZapicInc/Support/issues/new). Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample** or an **executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

### **Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?**

* Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.

* Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.

* Before submitting a PR, please check the specific SDK repository for more info on contributing guidelines and conventions.

### **Do you intend to add a new feature or change an existing one?**

* We suggest you open up a [new issue](https://github.com/ZapicInc/Support/issues/new) to talk about the changes before writing any code to ensure you have collected feedback from the community.

### **Do you have questions about the source code?**

* Ask any question about how to use Zapic in [Discord](https://discord.gg/Kduh53S). You will find specific channels for each of the different SDKs.

### **Do you want to contribute to the Zapic documentation?**

* We are always looking for ways to improve the documentation, please reach out to the team with any feedback. We are working on creating a repository for all documentation, stay tuned for updates!
